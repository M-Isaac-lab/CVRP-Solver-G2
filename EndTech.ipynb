    "# Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a complex combinatorial problem aimed at determining the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods to a set of customers while minimizing the total distance traveled. This project aims to solve the VRP using a genetic algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Algorithm Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Problem Definition\n",
    "We were tasked with solving a vehicle routing problem. We have decided that the vertices to be visited will be defined by their coordinates. In our case, we need to find routes to make delivery rounds to reach different cities across a large territory. We assume that the graph is complete and undirected. Moreover, most research datasets use the same constraints for their algorithm implementations. The objective is to visit each vertex exactly once and return to the starting point while minimizing the total distance traveled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The VRP can be formally defined as follows:\n",
    "- **Assumptions**:\n",
    "    - We are handling only one order.\n",
    "    - No time windows in which deliveries (or visits) must be made.\n",
    "    - Vehicles are not required to return to the depot (open routing problem).\n",
    "- **Input:**\n",
    "  - A set of customers with geographic coordinates.\n",
    "  - A specific demand for each customer.\n",
    "  - A fixed number of vehicles, each with limited capacity.\n",
    "  - A distance matrix between each pair of points (customer and depot).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output:**\n",
    "  - A set of routes for each vehicle, where each route starts and ends at the depot, and each customer is visited exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complexity Study\n",
    "\n",
    "The VRP is an NP-hard problem, which means there is no polynomial algorithm to solve it exactly for large instances. The complexity increases exponentially with the number of customers and vehicles. For instance, the simpler case of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the solution is to find a path where the salesman visits each city only once and returns to the starting city while minimizing costs, has a complexity of **n!**. If we have a computing power of 1,000,000 operations/second, we get the following results:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](img_solution/tsp.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if we only deal with 24 cities, we would need a time exceeding the age of the earth to find the optimal solution (if we were to test all possibilities). Therefore, we opt for a non-deterministic (meta-heuristic) solution that will give good results without necessarily being the best.\n",

    "Other algorithms like Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, and Ant Colony Optimization have their own strengths but may have limitations in terms of flexibility, scalability, or convergence time. This makes GAs a robust and versatile option for solving the VRP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functioning of the Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Genetic algorithms are heuristics belonging to the class of evolutionary algorithms, inspired by the process of natural selection. They are particularly effective for complex optimization problems like the VRP.<br>\n",
    "It is based on different elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Population:** represents a set of solutions to our problem.\n",
    "- **Chromosome:** a set of parameters that define a proposed solution to the problem the genetic algorithm is trying to solve.\n",
    "- **Gene:** an elementary piece of information of the chromosome. It can be binary or not.\n",
    "- **Generation:** the transition from one population to another. In general, we define the number of generations and make it the termination point.<br>\n",
    "![image.png](img_solution/gene.png)<br>\n",
    "- **Fitness Function:** an objective function used to summarize how close a given design solution is to achieving the set objectives. The fitness function is used to guide the simulations towards optimal design solutions. For a single-objective problem, the evaluation is straightforward; however, for a multi-objective problem, we talk about the Pareto front which characterizes multiple optimal solutions and then judges them according to certain criteria.\n",
    "- **Selection:** at each successive generation, a portion of the existing population is selected to generate a new generation. Individual solutions are selected through a fitness-based process, where better-fit solutions are generally more likely to be selected. Several types of selection can be listed, such as roulette selection, rank selection, and tournament selection.\n",
    "- **Crossover:** used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate a new offspring. It is a way of stochastically generating new solutions from an existing population.\n",
    "![image.png](img_solution/singlecross.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutation:** Used to maintain the genetic diversity of a generation of genetic algorithm chromosomes from one generation to the next.\n",
    "![image.png](img_solution/mutation.png)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main Steps:\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Generate an initial population of possible solutions.\n",
    "2. **Selection:** Choose the best solutions based on a fitness function.\n",
    "3. **Crossover:** Combine pairs of solutions to produce a new generation.\n",
    "4. **Mutation:** Make minor changes to some solutions to maintain diversity.\n",
    "5. **Evaluation:** Calculate the fitness function for each solution.\n",
    "6. **Iteration:** Repeat the steps of selection, crossover, and mutation until a convergence criterion is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters Used\n",
    "- **Population size:** Number of solutions considered at each iteration.\n",
    "- **Crossover probability:** Proportion of solutions combined to create new solutions.\n",
    "- **Mutation probability:** Proportion of solutions modified at each generation.\n",
    "- **Number of generations:** Total number of iterations of the evolutionary process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Algorithmic Specificities\n",
    "- **Elitism:** Preservation of the best solutions in each generation to ensure optimal convergence.\n",
    "- **Solution Repair:** Adjusting solutions to meet vehicle capacity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Modeling According to Algorithm Formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Representation\n",
    "Each solution is represented as a set of routes, where each route is an ordered sequence of customers served by a vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitness Function\n",
    "The fitness function evaluates the quality of a solution by calculating the total distance traveled by all vehicles, penalizing solutions that exceed vehicle capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Illustration with Different Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Case 1: Small Instance\n",
    "- **Description:** An instance with 5 customers and 2 vehicles.\n",
    "- **Results:** Presentation of the best solution found and comparison with a reference solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Case 2: Medium Instance\n",
    "- **Description:** An instance with 20 customers and 3 vehicles.\n",
    "- **Results:** Visualization of the solution and analysis of the algorithm's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Case 3: Large Instance\n",
